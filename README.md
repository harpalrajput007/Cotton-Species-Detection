# Cotton Species Detection App ðŸŒ¿

This is a Streamlit-based web application designed for farmers to detect cotton species from images using a YOLOv8 model. The app identifies the species, displays detailed information about it, provides a crop calendar with monthly tasks, and shares a fun fact about cotton. The UI features a clean design with styled cards, a cotton field background, and a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Image-Based Species Detection**: Upload an image of a cotton plant to detect its species using a pre-trained YOLOv8 model.
- **Species Information**: Displays details about the detected species, including origin, traits, care tips, use cases, and a bonus fact.
- **Crop Calendar**: Provides a monthly task list for the detected species to guide farmers through the growing season.
- **Fun Fact**: Shares a random educational fact about cotton.
- **Responsive UI**: Styled with a green theme, featuring cards with light green backgrounds, green borders, rounded corners, and shadows.
